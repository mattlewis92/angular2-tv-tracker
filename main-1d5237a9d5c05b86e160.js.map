The context for\n * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n * to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n * as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted).

If this information is new, please navigate to the\n * {\\@link Component#animations-anchor component animations metadata\n * page} to gain a better understanding of how animations in Angular2 are used.\n *\n * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given\n * amount of\n * time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected to be\n * used within {\\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\\@link group group}, or {\\@link transition\n * transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional\n * delay and easing values.

The context for\n * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n * to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n * as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n *\n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n *\n * With `<template>` element:\n *\n * ```\n * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </template>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nexport var NgFor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} _template\n     * @param {?} _differs\n     * @param {?} _cdr\n     */\n    function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._cdr = _cdr;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (isDevMode() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n                if ((console) && (console.warn)) {\n                    console.warn((\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn) + \". \") +\n                        \"See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.\");\n                }\n            }\n            this._trackByFn = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) {\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.
