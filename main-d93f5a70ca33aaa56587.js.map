The context for\n  * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n  * to the current item from the iterable.\n  * *\n  * ### Local Variables\n  * *\n  * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n  * *\n  * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n  * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n  * iteration.\n  * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n  * iteration.\n  * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n  * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n  * *\n  * ### Change Propagation\n  * *\n  * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n  * *\n  * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n  * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n  * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n  * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n  * *\n  * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n  * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n  * controls\n  * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n  * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n  * as user input.\n  * *\n  * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n  * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n  * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n  * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n  * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n  * be avoided if possible.\n  * *\n  * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n  * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n  * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n  * *\n  * ### Syntax\n  * *\n  * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n  * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n  * *\n  * With `<template>` element:\n  * *\n  * ```\n  * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n  * <li>...</li>\n  * </template>\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * ### Example\n  * *\n  * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n  * example.\n  * *\n */\nvar NgFor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} _template\n     * @param {?} _differs\n     * @param {?} _cdr\n     */\n    function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._cdr = _cdr;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._trackByFn = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) {\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__facade_lang__[\"f\" /* getTypeNameForDebugging */])(value) + \"'.

The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n  * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n  * delay=100, easing=ease-out`.\n  * If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the `duration` value in millisecond\n  * form.\n  * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {@link style style} or {@link\n  * keyframes keyframes}.\n  * If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected and used (this is\n  * useful when\n  * describing an animation step that will complete an animation by {@link\n  * transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n  * *\n  * ```typescript\n  * // various functions for specifying timing data\n  * animate(500, style(...))\n  * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n  * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n  * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n  * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n  * *\n  * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n  * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n  * animate(500, keyframes([\n  * style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n  * style({ background: \"red\" }))\n  * ])\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n  * *\n  * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n * @param {?} timing\n * @param {?=} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nexport function animate(timing, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    var /** @type {?} */ stylesEntry = styles;\n    if (!isPresent(stylesEntry)) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ EMPTY_STYLE = {};\n        stylesEntry = new AnimationStyleMetadata([EMPTY_STYLE], 1);\n    }\n    return new AnimationAnimateMetadata(timing, stylesEntry);\n}\n/**\n *  `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n  * animation\n  * DSL language.

Instead of applying animations from where they are\n  * currently to their destination, keyframes can describe how each style entry is applied\n  * and at what point within the animation arc (much like CSS Keyframe Animations do).\n  * *\n  * For each `style()` entry an `offset` value can be set.

The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 => state2`\n  * which consists\n  * of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting and/or ending state).\n  * *\n  * Animation transitions are placed within an {@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition\n  * to animate to\n  * a state value and persist its styles then one or more {@link state animation states} is expected\n  * to be defined.\n  * *\n  * ### Usage\n  * *\n  * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on\n  * what the\n  * previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition is\n  * defined that\n  * matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be triggered.\n  * *\n  * ```typescript\n  * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n  * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n  * // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n  * // animation has fully completed itself\n  * state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n  * state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n  * *\n  * // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n  * // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n  * transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n  * *\n  * // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n  * transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n  * *\n  * // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n  * transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n  * *\n  * // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n  * // the page and the destination state is unknown\n  * transition(\"void => *\", [\n  * style({ opacity: 0 }),\n  * animate(500)\n  * ]),\n  * *\n  * // this will capture a state change between any states\n  * transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n  * ])\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger`\n  * animation trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n  * *\n  * ```html\n  * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n  * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * #### The final `animate` call\n  * *\n  * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only**\n  * uses a timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final\n  * animation\n  * arc for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n  * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n  * applied state to be presented correctly.\n  * *\n  * ```\n  * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n  * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n  * transition(\"void => *\", [\n  * style({ opacity: 0 }),\n  * animate(500)\n  * ])\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n  * *\n  * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common,\n  * the `transition` function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which\n  * are aliases for the `void => *` and `* => void` state changes.\n  * *\n  * ```\n  * transition(\":enter\", [\n  * style({ opacity: 0 }),\n  * animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n  * ])\n  * transition(\":leave\", [\n  * animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n  * ])\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n  * *\n  * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @return {?}\n */\nexport function transition(stateChangeExpr, steps) {\n    var /** @type {?} */ animationData = Array.isArray(steps) ? new AnimationSequenceMetadata(steps) : steps;\n    return new AnimationStateTransitionMetadata(stateChangeExpr, animationData);\n}\n/**\n *  `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n  * animation\n  * DSL language.

The context for\n  * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n  * to the current item from the iterable.\n  * *\n  * ### Local Variables\n  * *\n  * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n  * *\n  * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n  * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n  * iteration.\n  * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n  * iteration.\n  * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n  * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n  * *\n  * ### Change Propagation\n  * *\n  * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n  * *\n  * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n  * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n  * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n  * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n  * *\n  * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n  * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n  * controls\n  * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n  * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n  * as user input.\n  * *\n  * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n  * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n  * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n  * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n  * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n  * be avoided if possible.\n  * *\n  * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n  * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n  * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n  * *\n  * ### Syntax\n  * *\n  * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n  * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n  * *\n  * With `<template>` element:\n  * *\n  * ```\n  * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n  * <li>...</li>\n  * </template>\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * ### Example\n  * *\n  * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n  * example.\n  * *\n */\nexport var NgFor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} _template\n     * @param {?} _differs\n     * @param {?} _cdr\n     */\n    function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._cdr = _cdr;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._trackByFn = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) {\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.
